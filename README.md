# 🧠 CodSoft Internship Project - Python Projects

Welcome to my **CodSoft Internship Project Repository**!  
As part of the internship, I created a set of mini Python projects to strengthen my understanding of programming logic, GUI development, and core Python modules.

## 🚀 Projects Included

1. ✅ **To-Do List**
   - A simple task manager to add, delete, and mark tasks as complete.
   - Built using `Tkinter` for GUI.

2. ✂️ **Rock-Paper-Scissors Game**
   - A classic terminal-based game where you play against the computer.
   - Uses `random` module for computer moves.

3. 🧮 **Calculator**
   - A GUI-based calculator supporting basic arithmetic operations.
   - Built using `Tkinter`.

4. 📇 **Contact Book**
   - Save, search, update, and delete contact details.
   - Uses file handling to store contact data persistently.

5. 🔐 **Password Generator**
   - Generates strong random passwords using a mix of characters.
   - Allows custom length and character types (symbols, numbers, letters).
